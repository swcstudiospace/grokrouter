# Fresh-Bot release gate

This is the acceptance test. An existing Bot is not enough: create a brand-new Bot after installing the candidate build.

## Sixty-second control proof

1. Create a brand-new Bot in Grok Bot.
2. Wait for its automatic greeting. Confirm it is one short normal greeting with no router error, tool permission prompt, launch acknowledgement, or dynamic-tool activity in the audit.
3. Type `/` without sending. Confirm Grok's native suggestion menu lists `provider`, `models`, `model`, `reasoning`, `router`, and `doctor`, or that `/router doctor` reports an explicit user-skill name conflict for any missing entry.
4. Select `/doctor` from the menu and send it. Confirm the candidate router version, slash-discovery status, and credential/runtime health. `/router doctor` must return the same health receipt.
5. Select `/models` from the menu and send it. Confirm the list ends with an explicit switch instruction.
6. Paste one catalog `vendor/model` ID by itself and send it. Repeat with an ID that is in the live catalog but outside the packaged shortlist (find one via `/models search`); it must switch with the same receipt shape.
7. Send `/provider`. Confirm the exact provider and model.
8. Ask `What provider and model are you using?` Confirm the answer agrees with `/provider` and does not deny the router controls.
9. Ask `Reply with exactly FRESH_BOT_TEXT_OK and nothing else.` Confirm one reply appears—no duplicate follow-up bubbles.
10. Create a second brand-new Bot and send `/provider`. Confirm it starts on the installer default instead of inheriting the first Bot's override.

Before release, also send `/Provider`, `/Router   Doctor`, `/router foo`, `/provider open router`, `/reasoning MAX`, and one unlisted `vendor/model` ID. Every input must return router status/help without a model-authored denial or invented answer.

`/models <id>` must also switch successfully because older demos and natural user behavior commonly use the plural command.

## Capability proof

In the same first Bot, prove each enabled provider with reversible, non-sensitive work:

- Create a small proof file with Grok's outer `Shell`, read it with outer `Read`, and verify the exact contents.
- Request a screenshot and identify one visible, non-sensitive window.
- Discover and run one small dynamic sub-agent task. Wait for the finished child's result to appear in the parent chat. A launch acknowledgement or `CheckSubagent` status alone is not a pass.
- For OpenRouter, inspect the first request/audit receipt: an explicit delegation request must force a supplied dedicated orchestration tool or `GetDynamicTools`. If the host supplied zero actionable schemas, the visible answer must state that limitation and must not claim a child started.
- After the child result appears, wait through the next host continuation and confirm the result is not inferred or delivered a second time.
- Inspect the redacted audit log and confirm the exact provider/model and expected tool names.
- Confirm every suppressed host continuation produces a redacted `turn_suppressed` receipt with a specific reason. A silent audit gap is a failure.
- Confirm provider tool-call IDs in the audit use the `grokbot-router-tool-` prefix instead of a provider-supplied raw identifier.

## Release decision

The candidate fails if the automatic greeting invokes a tool or errors, any command reaches the model as ordinary chat, a response is delivered more than once, state leaks between Bots, a permission receipt fails to resume its outstanding tool call, the visible receipt disagrees with the audit, a background child finishes without reviving the parent, or a claimed tool path lacks a real live result.

Native slash discovery and deterministic command handling are separate acceptance checks. A menu entry proves only that Grok found the packaged skill descriptor; the exact control receipt and zero provider request prove that GrokRouter handled the command.
