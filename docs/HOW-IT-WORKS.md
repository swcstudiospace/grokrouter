# How it works, without the jargon

The shortest explanation is: **Grok Bot keeps being the app you use, while a small router lets each Bot choose a different AI model for the actual thinking.**

## Read the diagram in 45 seconds

1. **You type in Grok Bot.** The app, Bot, conversation history, files and computer stay where they already are.
2. **The router checks that Bot's saved choice.** One Bot can use Claude through OpenRouter, another a Codex model, another Claude through the Claude Agent SDK, another Grok through an xAI subscription, and changing one does not change the others.
3. **The chosen AI handles the turn.** The router sends the cleaned conversation and the tools Grok made available for that turn to the Codex SDK, OpenRouter, the Claude Agent SDK, or xAI.
4. **The answer returns to the same chat.** You do not move to another app or learn another interface.
5. **If an action is needed, Grok still does it.** The selected AI can request a computer, file, browser or orchestration tool only when Grok supplied that tool for the turn. Grok's permission layer still applies. The result goes back to the same selected AI, which finishes the answer.
6. **Recovery is built in.** Installation verifies that the Grok host is genuinely stock, saves the untouched original, and can restore the stock inference path later.

## What happens during installation

The native macOS installer—and the preview Windows installer built around the same payload—is a guided delivery mechanism. It does not replace the Grok Bot app. On both platforms a source installer (`scripts/install-macos.sh`, or `scripts/install-windows.ps1` on Windows 10/11) downloads the pinned tag and builds the installer app locally; the Windows one needs Node.js 22.12+ and Git for Windows, which it names but never installs.

1. It confirms that the installed desktop app is an official, vendor-signed Grok Bot whose exact version is listed in `compatibility/supported-apps.json` (0.30.0, 0.36.0, 0.44.0). Each listed version has its own manifest and signed host registry; a match on one version never authorizes another. A version newer than all of them is refused unless the user checked **Allow unreviewed Grok Bot version (experimental)**. Older or in-between versions are always refused.
2. It restarts Grok Bot with a temporary diagnostic connection bound only to `127.0.0.1` on the local computer.
3. It opens an existing Bot computer and verifies that its Terminal is really focused before typing anything.
4. It transfers a small compressed payload through Grok's own remote-computer connection. The payload is checked with SHA-256 before extraction.
5. Inside the Bot computer, it installs pinned runtime dependencies and selects the manifest for that exact desktop version. For a reviewed version it requires an exact reviewed stock-host SHA-256 and byte count from the bundled manifest or that version's Ed25519-signed registry. Every source anchor and each of the three patch seams (group member dispatch, memory extraction, episode summary) must match exactly once, and the transformed code must pass `node --check`. Structural similarity alone never authenticates a reviewed version's host. The untouched original is stored under persistent `sand-data` before patching.
6. It installs the narrow provider adapter. The runtime recognizes Grok's existing completion identity when returning child results to the parent. The larger provider logic remains in a separate runtime that can be replaced or removed independently.
7. It verifies the payload success marker and native command registration, then restarts the Grok host, verifies the restart receipt, closes the diagnostic connection and reopens Grok Bot normally.

If the app version, source anchors, payload checksum, registry signature, Terminal focus or generated code does not match expectations, installation stops rather than guessing. A rejected host produces a safe fingerprint, the anchor and patch-seam counts (`ANCHORS`, `PATCHANCHORS`), the read-only syntax result (`PATCHDRYRUN`), the trust tier, and the reason; Grok host source is never uploaded. The Bot terminal is read back through screenshot OCR, so installer attempt IDs use only characters OCR does not confuse, and the completion timeout restarts whenever a new phase is observed.

### An unreviewed, newer Grok Bot

With the experimental checkbox on and a version newer than every reviewed one, there is no reviewed hash to compare. The Bot computer instead uses the newest reviewed manifest whose anchors all appear exactly once on the live host and checks the host structurally: no router marker, every anchor and patch seam exactly once, a read-only patch that passes `node --check`, and a size inside that manifest's band. It backs up the untouched host first. Doctor then reports `HOSTTRUST=UNREVIEWED-ANCHOR-VERIFIED` and an `UNREVIEWED VERSION` line. If anything moved, installation stops before changing anything.

This is weaker than a reviewed version. Structural checks cannot prove the backup is genuine stock code, so the option is off by default and never used for a reviewed version. **Restore Stock Grok Bot** returns the backed-up host.

## What happens when you send a message

### A normal conversation turn

1. Grok creates the same conversation session it normally would.
2. The injected executor starts the isolated router runtime and supplies the transcript, stable Bot identifiers and any tools Grok offered for that turn.
3. The runtime loads this Bot's provider and model from its own state file.
4. Codex SDK resumes that Bot's Codex thread; the Claude Agent SDK resumes that Bot's Claude session; OpenRouter or xAI receives an OpenAI-compatible request for the selected model.
5. The provider returns text.
6. The runtime hands that text to Grok's normal delivery mechanism, so it appears once in the original conversation.

The original beta.32 failure came from treating a changing request ID as part of the Bot's identity. That made a model switch look successful but sent the next message to a new default state file. Stable IDs now take priority, with a real Bot ID winning over the channel or conversation around it. That lets a Bot retain its own model when it joins a group, and changing the group's membership does not change the Bot's router state. Existing combined-ID state is migrated on first use.

### A router command

Commands such as `/models`, `/provider`, `/doctor`, and `/router doctor` are handled by the router before any provider request is made. Small user-invocable skill descriptors make the command families discoverable in Grok's native `/` menu, while the runtime remains the only component that performs the control. You can choose an entry from that menu or type the literal command into the normal composer. In a channel, put a Bot mention directly before the command—for example, `@Research Bot /provider`—to inspect or change that Bot without affecting another member. That is why a model cannot deny that the commands exist or invent a different answer.

### A tool turn

1. Grok may include tool definitions with the turn.
2. The router translates those exact schemas into the format the selected provider expects.
3. The selected AI may return a structured request for one of those tools.
4. Grok performs the action and applies its normal permission behavior.
5. The matching result returns to the same provider thread.
6. Only then does the provider produce the final chat answer.

The router will not execute a provider's printed imitation of a tool call when Grok supplied no matching schema. The latest OpenRouter Shell gate had zero actionable host schemas, so the request correctly remained inert. Computer, Screenshot and sub-agent parity are therefore not blanket current-release claims even though the bridge and automated contracts exist.

## What stays, what changes

| Stays in Grok Bot | Changes through the router |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop app and chat interface | Model used for inference |
| Bots and conversation history | Per-Bot provider/model setting |
| Bot computer and `/workspace` | Provider thread identifier |
| Files, browser and host tools | Translation between provider calls and Grok tool schemas |
| Grok permission behavior | Redacted router audit and diagnostics |

The stock Grok model is bypassed only for routed turns. Disabling or restoring the router returns the original inference path.

## What each Bot remembers

Every Bot gets an isolated state record containing its provider, model, reasoning setting, provider thread reference and replay-control metadata. Updates are written atomically under a short per-Bot lock. A model switch or reset increments the thread epoch, so a late response cannot silently undo the change.

This is why the acceptance test always creates two new Bots: the first is switched to Luna, while the second must still start on the installer default.

## Credentials and data boundaries

- The OpenRouter key is saved through Grok Bot's protected Secrets store and loaded only when a request is made.
- Anthropic sign-in belongs to the Claude Agent SDK's bundled binary (`claude auth login --claudeai`, or `setup-token` when the Bot terminal has no browser). The router never handles a claude.ai OAuth token and ignores an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment so a Pro/Max subscription is not shadowed by API billing. A model shown by `/models` is not proof that a turn billed the plan; `grokbot-router doctor` prints `signedIn` and `subscription` without the account email.
- The xAI sign-in uses xAI's public device-code flow. Tokens live in an owner-only file inside the Bot computer, are refreshed automatically, and are sent only to `api.x.ai` or xAI's subscription proxy.
- Provider credentials are not written to this repository, per-Bot state files or audit logs.
- The chosen provider necessarily receives the conversation content and media needed to answer that routed turn.
- Grok remains the executor for outer computer, file, browser and orchestration tools. A provider receives their results only when that tool path actually runs.
- Audit events contain bounded protocol information, provider/model receipts and suppression reasons; recognizable key material and raw provider error payloads are redacted.
- Child processes receive an explicit environment allowlist rather than every host environment variable.

## Restore, disable and update

- **Restore Stock Grok Bot** copies the SHA-256-verified persistent backup over the routed host, disables routing and restarts the host after the installer sees the restore marker.
- `grokbot-router disable` leaves the adapter installed but sends new sessions down the stock path.
- `grokbot-router enable` turns routing back on.
- A newer Grok Bot version is not reviewed until its exact host is probed inside a Bot computer, its hash and anchors are added and signed, and the complete automated plus fresh-Bot live gate passes. See [VERSION-TRACKING.md](VERSION-TRACKING.md).

The latest recorded complete Mac lifecycle is upstream beta.47 on 0.30.0 and 0.36.0. The beta.48 candidate, 0.44.0, and the unreviewed opt-in must pass their own live gate. See [TEST-MATRIX.md](TEST-MATRIX.md) for the evidence rather than relying on the diagram as a test claim.

## How new models appear

The router asks each provider for its current model list instead of relying only on a packaged shortlist: OpenRouter's public catalog, xAI's authenticated `/v1/models`, the Claude Agent SDK's `supportedModels()`, and the pinned Codex CLI's `codex debug models`. Each list is cached for one hour. If a provider cannot be reached, the router uses the cached copy, then the packaged list, so a discovery problem never breaks a chat turn. `/models refresh` asks again right away.

Family names such as `/model sonnet`, `/model sol` or `/model grok` pick the newest model of that family in the cached list, so a new release is usable the day it appears without a GrokRouter update. A Bot keeps the model it has until you switch it.

## Suggested 55-second YouTube narration

> The easiest way to understand this is that Grok Bot stays the same, but the AI brain can change. I still type inside the normal Grok Bot chat. A small router checks which model this specific Bot is set to use, then sends the turn to Codex or a model through OpenRouter. The answer comes straight back into the same conversation.
>
> If the AI needs to use the computer, a file or the browser, it can only request a tool Grok actually made available, and Grok's normal permissions still apply. Grok performs the action, sends the result back to the selected model, and the final answer appears here.
>
> The installer also checks the exact Grok version and saves a verified copy of the original host. So if I want to undo the whole thing, Restore Stock puts Grok's original inference path back.

## Native memory tasks

The chat executor also supplies Grok's memory-extraction and periodic episode-summary helpers. Each exact native call receives its own dedicated task marker: the selected Bot provider processes its original instructions without chat commands, cached tools, saved chat threads, or conversation/completion receipts. Results return directly to the host as text. Codex uses a separate read-only helper thread with network and web search disabled. Helper events are recorded separately from chat inference, without prompt or memory contents.

Explicit native maintenance sessions (`isSummarizationSession`) retain the host's original inference implementation. Memory synthesis has a separate structured-text contract and is not routed through the chat response wrapper. This is an inference boundary, not a claim that all internal Grok work uses the selected chat provider.
